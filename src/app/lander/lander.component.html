<!--
Here we are going to develop in the front general website for the platform. Essentially we are going to have one
closed screen with a sign up or join dialog. We will have a navigation at the top of the screen that will have simple
links to about, help and the like.

We should then begin running through the layout of the application...
-->

<!--
This is the navigation bar down here...
-->
<app-navigation class="tw-w-full tw-h-16 tw-shadow tw-flex tw-justify-between tw-items-center navigation"></app-navigation>

<!--
Here we will put the content of the page...we will flex it row wise
-->
<div class="tw-flex tw-flex-1">
  <!--
  So in here we are going to have two panels to display a splash jumbo as well as the actual joining dialog...
  -->
  <app-left class="tw-flex tw-flex-col tw-flex-1 tw-justify-center tw-items-center"></app-left>
  <app-join class="tw-flex tw-flex-col tw-flex-1 tw-justify-center tw-items-center"></app-join>
</div>

<!--
Here we will have the footer of the page
-->
<div></div>

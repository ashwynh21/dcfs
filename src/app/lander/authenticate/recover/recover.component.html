  Now let us begin setting up the inputs of the form and bind it into the frame. we will also have to put the logo
  in and the title of the form so that the user is able to tell from just the title what they will need to do.
  finally we will also need to add in google and facebook sign in so that the user is able to use those platforms
  to gain access to the system.

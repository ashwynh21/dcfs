All the content in the div below is for start up users and will only show if there are some parts of their profile
that still need completion...
with that said we should then wrap an if for the view
-->
<app-beginner *ngIf="!show(user | async)" [user]="user | async"></app-beginner>
<!--
Down here we then need to use this space to show the remaining aspects of the user dashboard...
